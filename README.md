# Introduction

The Data-Pagination-And-Filtering was created in Unit #2 of the Techdegree course at teamtreehouse.com.
All files were provided except the script.js file. In the script.js file I added functionality to
display 9 students per page with pagination buttons. Lastly I created the search bar feature at the top of the page.
Allowing the user to filter through the students.
